        <h1>Description and history of the project</h1>
        <p>Synergy-Engine - a C++ game engine using Vulkan and OpenGL</p>
        <p>The idea was taken after a failed attempt to remake Valve's Source game engine</p>
        <p>For the basis of our game engine was taken the project of youtuber tokyospliff, namely Hell2025</p>
        <p>Our main goal is to rewrite the code to the g++ compiler and makefile scripts, and add tools to simplify game creation</p>
